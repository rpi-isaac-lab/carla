def get_target_point(lookahead, polyline):
    """
    Determines the target point for the Pure Pursuit controller.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lookahead : float
        The radius of the lookahead circle, centered at the vehicle's rear axle (assumed to be at (0, 0)).
    
    polyline : array_like, shape (M, 2)
        A list of 2D points representing the path to follow. Each consecutive pair defines a segment of the path.

    Returns
    -------
    target_point : numpy array, shape (2,)
        A point where the lookahead circle intersects the path, lies in front of the vehicle (x > 0),
        and has a direction angle |arctan(y/x)| > π/4 (i.e., at least 45° off from straight ahead).
        Returns the first such point found in path order.
        Returns None if no valid intersection exists.
